# Multi-CALF: Critic as a Lyapunov Function

This repository contains the demo implementation of the Multi-CALF (Critic as a Lyapunov Function) approach described in the paper [TODO PASTE PAPER NAME HERE].

## Project Overview

Multi-CALF is a reinforcement learning approach that uses the critic function as a Lyapunov function to ensure stability and safety during training and deployment. This repository provides a demonstration of how Multi-CALF works in practice.

We have constructed a visual pendulum environment specifically for this demonstration, which provides image-based observations of a pendulum system. This allows for testing the Multi-CALF approach in a setting where the agent must learn from high-dimensional visual inputs rather than low-dimensional state representations.

## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. uv is a fast, reliable Python package installer and resolver.

### Installing uv

To install uv, run:

```bash
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```

Or on Windows:

```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Setting up the environment
   sudo apt-get install -y libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglfw3  for offline render
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-calf.git
   cd multi-calf
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.13.2:
   ```bash
   uv venv --python=3.13.2
   uv sync
   ```

## Running Experiments

### Training

To train a PPO agent on the visual pendulum environment:

```bash
uv run run/train_ppo_vispendulum.py
```

You can customize the training parameters by modifying the arguments:

```bash
uv run run/train_ppo_vispendulum.py --seed 42 --total-timesteps 500000 --learning-rate 3e-4
```

For the full details about training parameters type
```bash
uv run run/train_ppo_vispendulum.py --help
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
uv run run/eval.py --checkpoint-path run/artifacts/path/to/your/checkpoint
```

## Tracking Experiments

This project uses MLflow for experiment tracking. You can view the experiment results by running:

```bash
cd run
mlflow ui --port=5000
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
